test_hello.c has been verified against the Odroid-XU4 board.

Procedure detailed in our note book.
Will replicate it here when i have time.

Note we use #18 pin (it is NOT the 18th pin, but rather is a pin name) on the Odroid-XU4 board + Shield.

NOTE : test_hello.c is compiled using the make -j4 command on the Odroid-XU4 target in the odroid kernal code directory.
Its NOT meant to be used with the Makefile seen in this directory.
