test_hello.c has been verified against the Odroid-XU4 board.

Procedure detailed in our note book.
Will replicate it here when i have time.

Note we use #18 pin (it is NOT the 18th pin, but rather is a pin name) on the Odroid-XU4 board + Shield.


Note:
This test_hello.c is an addition to the one found in day36/7.  (Lec 65)
It does a dump_stack().  
You can see the hard irq (button_handler) and soft irq (my_action).
