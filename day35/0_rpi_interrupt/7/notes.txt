GPIOs mapped to IRQ
====================

Input GPIOs can often be used as IRQ signals. Such IRQs can be edge-triggered or level-triggered.

The GPIO controller is responsible for providing the mapping between the GPIO and its IRQ. 

You can use gpio_to_irq() to map a given GPIO number to its IRQ number:

int gpio_to_irq(unsigned gpio);

The return value is the IRQ number, on which you can call request_irq()
