Top Half and Bottom Half
================================

Two important goals of interrupt handler are:

Execution Time
-----------------

	Handler of an interrupt must execute quickly

		long running handlers can slow down the system and may also lead to losing interrupts

		The faster the handler returns, the lower the interrupt latencies in the kernel, which is especially important for real-time systems

Execution Context
------------------

	Interrupt handlers are executed in hard-interrupt context â€“ CPU-local interrupts remain disabled
		
		locking is undesirable and sleeping must be avoided
		large amount of work cannot be performed in interrupt handler


Both limitations lead to the fact that most interrupt handlers execute only a small amount of code and defer the rest of the work to a later point in time

Handling of interrupts is divided into two parts:

1. Top Half (Hard IRQ)
	Acknowledge the interrupt
	Copy the necessary stuff from the device
	schedule the bottom half

2. Bottom Half (Soft IRQ)
	Remaining pending work
