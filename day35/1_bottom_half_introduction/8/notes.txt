IRQF_ONESHOT
=============

The interrupt is not reenabled after the IRQ handler finishes

This flag is required for threaded interrupts which need to keep the interrupt line disabled until the threaded handler has run

Specifying this flag is mandatory if the primary handler is set to NULL.

The default primary handler does nothing more than to return IRQ WAKE THREAD to wake up a kernel thread to execute the thread fn IRQ handler.
